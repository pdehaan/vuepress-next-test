  notes:
    - label: "NOTE[1]"
      text: I premix equal parts chia seeds, hemp seeds, and buckwheat groats in a small [500mL] canning jar, and then just add 1 Tbsp of the mix into my oatmeal instead of measuring each ingredient individually each morning.
    - label: "$$$"
      text: I find that this recipe is also delicious if I use a half-water half-milk combination. We make our own almond milk and store it in 18 oz bottles, so it's fairly quick to fill an empty bottle w/ about 9 oz of water and then fill with milk. Saves a bit of money and tastes about the same!
    - text: Oatmeal is pretty versatile. It's super easy to tweak the flavors with whatever you have on hand. So we'll often put in frozen berries, or fresh apples, or whatever is in season!
